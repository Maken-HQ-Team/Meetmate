### 2. Component Structure

The chat system is organized into these main components:

```
src/components/chat/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ContactList.tsx          # Contact and group list

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ContactProfile.tsx       # Contact information and settings
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ GroupProfile.tsx         # Group information and management
```

### 3. Hooks

The system uses these custom hooks:

```
src/hooks/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ useContacts.ts           # Manage contacts and relationships
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ useGroups.ts             # Manage groups and memberships

<Route path="/conversations" element={<Conversations />} />
```

### 5. Navigation

Add a Conversations button to your main page:

```tsx
// In Index.tsx
<Button variant="outline" onClick={() => window.location.href = '/conversations'}>

  Conversations
</Button>
```
